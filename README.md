**TextDiffTool** is a lightweight, web-based tool to compare text side-by-side with a clean interface. It highlights additions and removals with color coding, includes line numbers, and offers adjustable font sizes for better readability. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses [Diff.js](https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff) for efficient text comparison.

- **Line Numbers**: Track changes with numbered lines.
- **Color-Coded Diffs**: Additions (green) and removals (red) are highlighted.
